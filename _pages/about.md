Hi there! Welcome to my website. ðŸ˜Š
<br><br>I'm Harsh, a Ph.D. student in the [School of Engineering and Applied Science](https://engineering.virginia.edu/) at the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/), advised by [Prof. Negin Alemazkoor]( https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/negin-alemazkoor). I completed my M.S. from [The Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/), advised by [Dr. Mohamad Darayi]( https://greatvalley.psu.edu/person/mohamad-darayi). I earned my B.Tech from [Manipal University]( https://manipal.edu/mit.html).
<br><br>My research interests broadly lie in machine learning, deep learning, data-driven decision making, and simulation-optimization. Specifically, I would like to apply these in adversarial settings, interdependent infrastructure system networks, computational sustainability problems like energy and urban mobility, and social issues like security and planning. My work has been [published ](publications) or is forthcoming in [The Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS)]( https://www.informs.org/), [Institute of Industrial and Systems Engineers (IISE)](https://iise.org/Home/), and [Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS)](https://complexsystems.mst.edu/) conference.
<br><br>Previously, I have spent a wonderful five years working as Senior Data Scientist in the Advanced Analytics team of [A.T. Kearney](https://www.kearney.com/). I also had the chance to work in the AI Research Lab of [Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)](https://www.tcs.com/).
