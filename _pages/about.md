Hi there! Welcome to my website. ðŸ˜Š
<br><br>I'm Harsh, an incoming Ph.D. student in Systems Engineering at the [Engineering Systems and Environment](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/engineering-systems-and-environment) department of the [University of Virginia]( https://engineering.virginia.edu/). I will be advised by [Dr. Negin Alemazkoor]( https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/negin-alemazkoor). I completed my M.S. from [The Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/), advised by [Dr. Mohamad Darayi]( https://greatvalley.psu.edu/person/mohamad-darayi). I earned my B.Tech. from [Manipal University]( https://manipal.edu/mit.html).
<br><br>My research interests broadly lie in machine learning, deep learning, data-driven decision making, and simulation-optimization. Specifically, I would like to apply these in adversarial settings, interdependent infrastructure system networks, computational sustainability problems like energy and urban mobility, and social issues like security and planning. My work has been [published ](publications) or is forthcoming in [The Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS)]( https://www.informs.org/), [Institute of Industrial and Systems Engineers (IISE)](https://iise.org/Home/), and [Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS)](https://complexsystems.mst.edu/) conference.
<br><br>Previously, I spent a wonderful three years at A.T. Kearney working with [Bharath Thota](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bharaththota), [Jules Goffre](https://www.kearney.com/jules-a-goffre) and [Rajendra Jain](https://in.linkedin.com/in/rajendra-jain-ba668817). I also had the chance to work in the AI Research Lab of [Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)](https://www.tcs.com/)
